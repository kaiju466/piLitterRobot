# piLitterRobot
Code for basic integration of Raspberry Pi into Litter-Robot 3 using a GeekWorm Pi MotorHat

This code is built off code for the PiMotorHat by GeekWorm (https://raspberrypiwiki.com/Robot_Expansion_Board). 




Parts list:
  Raspberry Pi 3b(any pi with a gpio should potentially work though weak hardware will be slow)
  LitterRobot3
  12V powersupply (or original Litter-Robot 3 powersupply)
  5V powersupply or voltage transformer(can use a dedicated supply or modify a carlighter usb adaptor)
  3144E A3144 KY-003 HallEffect Sensors(2)
  GeekWorm PiMotorHat
  
  
Note: Current Hardware interation is a prototype and majority of parts are in a separate plastic case due to limited space in the existing hardware.
